hibernate--

object state-
 on creation new -- Transient
 on save() /persist() -- Persistent // once persisted any change in object will be implicitly persisted in database as well.
 on detach()  -- Detached
 on remove()  -- Removed

  - When we do get() then we fetch the object , but it also gets into persisted state.


---cache-

Whenever we fire a query hibernate checks if it has value in first level cache. If yes, it retrieves from it. So it does not fire query in database.
