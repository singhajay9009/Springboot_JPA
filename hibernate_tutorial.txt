hibernate--

object state-
 on creation new -- Transient
 on save() /persist() -- Persistent // once persisted any change in object will be implicitly persisted in database as well.
 on detach()  -- Detached
 on remove()  -- Removed

  - When we do get() then we fetch the object , but it also gets into persisted state.
